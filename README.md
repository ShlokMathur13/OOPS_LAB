# OOPS_LAB

Welcome to the **OOPS_LAB** repository! This repository contains a collection of C++ programs that I have developed as part of my ongoing practice in C++ programming. The code here covers a range of fundamental concepts and problem-solving techniques in C++.

## Features

- **Basic Syntax and Constructs**: Includes examples of loops, conditionals, functions, and other fundamental constructs.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Contains basic implementations of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Problem-Solving**: Solutions to common C++ practice problems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different directories, each corresponding to a specific topic or concept. Here's an overview of the structure:
